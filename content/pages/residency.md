      Every resident gets the chance to attend an in-person week-long colocation
      week. It’s a chance to meet members of the PL Network in real life. You
      will attend in person sessions and live demos from experts in the web3
      community. At the same time you’ll get to build a strong network with
      other residents in the program. Oh, we also go to awesome places like
      Amsterdam, Iceland and Austin. Most of the time colo week is held in
      conjunction with other web3 community events like Devconnect or Consensus
      Festival.

    body: "We believe people do best when they’re working on projects they're excited about. With 30+ teams within Protocol Labs and 300+ companies in the Protocol Labs Network (PLN) now is a great time for people coming both inside and outside the web3 space to ramp up their knowledge and contribute to these cutting-edge technologies directly.\n\nFrom core distributed systems engineers to network researchers, to developer advocates, to technical writers, to startup operators, there are many exciting roles and opportunities across PLN teams and companies. Many of our engineers coming into the PLN have the skillset to fill many of these roles and it can be hard to pick just one to interview for. The Launchpad residency allows for you to explore different teams, solve complex problems from the first day you are hired, and team-match after being exposed to our entire ecosystem.\n\n\nOur teams are made up of people captivated by solving deep technical challenges. We’re open source and remote. We have engineers working across every time zone.\n‍\nThe Residency program is designed for engineers that could be a fit in several roles across the Protocol Labs Network. We know great engineers can come from a variety of backgrounds.\_Before joining the Launchpad Residency our alumni have been tech leads in web2, startup owners, product managers at FAANG companies, Ethereum Hackathon winners, and top open source contributors. \_\n"
